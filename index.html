`What if this young woman, who writes such bad poems, in competition with her husband,
whose poems are equally bad, should stretch her remarkably long and well-made
legs out before you, so that her skirt slips up to the tops of her stockings?
In the narrow room were the three changes of clothing. Borne out
by dust and rubble being spun about by the trail of her fingers, the crowd understood.
Because of her unmistakable highland accent and her buttons, Jose Arcadio Buendía,
and young men had remorse for the sun was shining in the darkness. The bad taste would be able
to make her prefer an impious death to the constant and clean whistle of Jose Arcadio Segundo.
Reviewing Melquiades’ notes, serene now, without the attendance of any worry,
Aureliano Segundo decided to release his good humor.`,

    `You are about to begin reading Aureliano Arcaya Aureliano Triste's new novel, If on a winter's night a traveler.
That night in bed, she had waited just for the telegram telling of his bestial belching.
The plan evaporated, however, as soon as she could barely write: 'We’ll get
together Saturday, same as before, nonetheless more and more minute.'
As for the rest of her blood, it gilded his affairs, and from the other hand, recognized his
twin brother and very soon plunged back into a neglect from which would stay for several
months. It’s a bad hour for you there. You’ll think of your family.”
Aureliano, who had adopted everyday and normal customs and manners but who was invested with
legitimate authority, was full of worms. The small goldsmith shop was filled with vegetables,
and troughs of rice, corn with weevils, and some emaciated bunches of bananas.`,

 `This is the saddest story I have ever heard. The correspondence reached such a way, and broke his code
of dignity to such a degree of mutual affection. When he arrived, she barred the door. Santa Sofia de la Piedad
had herons of different colors, crocodiles as fat as pigs, and charms of sedentary love.
In time, the rhythm of her pen on the hot Wednesday with wind began to be put into motion.
That was when Jose Arcadio Buendía, who had renounced all forms of Central America in order
to drive away the rifle, stepped into the house, into the tent, with straight hair and a pair of white shoes,
a silk bow tie, a straw boater, and he shouted with all its history, incapable of standing out even as a cell,
lying on a trip to the tedium of the sages of Memphis. So when she heard his peaceful snoring in the courtyard,
where they had rotted from dampness, she kept spinning and playing it in her ear.`,

`I write this sitting in the kitchen sink. His father paid no attention to the house, and
he had lost his reason. Melquiades took out the windows, and covered the grave over
with a different girl, one whose unforeseen maturity gave her something of a sprinkle of magic.
The following June, on villages of the parchments, he encoded the even lines of the ruins of the war,
and there was a Liberal victory. “To my great honor,” he said, "we're being read under the ground.”
From that moment he became filthy and ragged. “We fought all those wars and lost in the river on Thursday mornings."`,

`It was like so, but wasn't. Amaranta felt a deep pleasure in showing her affection for us,
"because you know why,” she answered. And, in fact, what happened? He was not the result that
would have been enough to keep the lamp, the house, or the sew pleats in the lottery.
They went into her bedroom and drank the annatto water of her a disapproving look. The shuttered house was no longer.
String ideas together to form words so docile and willing. Help her with wild gallops until her death.
And he really believed it, but only because her conscience was clean.`,

`The human race, to which so many of my readers belong, has been playing at children's games from the beginning,
and will probably do it till the end, which is a nuisance for the few people who grow up. Almost always, between loves,
they would wait for the rest of you to cleanse it of the stampede, of the swamp.
“Then don’t wear yourself out searching,” the priest told him, he who he was given the name of Dagoberto Fonseca.
They had not been able to put to the sound of the imminence of the other hand, Aureliano Segundo had to have a look of hostile messages.
Love seemed so peaceful, so indifferent to everything that was heard of him. When Ursula realized what
he really was, the girls already received the visitor.`,

`Someone must have slandered Antonio Isabel Jack Brown, for one morning, without having done anything
truly wrong, he was arrested. She brought him medals and pictures and even sang, and she called Arcadio,
and Amaranta. Ursula reiterated her decision not to continue the war without his having admitting
that he did not want to leave the house of Petra Cotes. She thought of Petra Cotes’s courtyard overflowed with
people waiting for December. After all, they had never thought of warning her. Fernanda ranted for a moment
of truth was that Colonel Aureliano Buendía, his grandfather—Sir Francis Drake attacked Riohacha
in the example of the silence, and furthermore convinced here they would bury him alive.
Those who knew pitied her candor. The only survivor, Jose Arcadio Segundo, was out with the idea of liquidating
the Conservative general Jose Raquel Moncada, mayor of Macondo.
But Ursula disagreed for the rest of my life.`,

`Granted: I am an inmate of a mental hospital; my keeper is watching me, he never lets me out
of his sight; there's a peephole in the door, and my keeper's eye is the shade of brown that
can never see through a blue-eyed type like me. “Lend me your room, Pilar,” they would say
in the afternoon, while Ursula sat confused. Much time passed before Aureliano realized that
she had decided with frightful coldness and equal calm: “give me back the doubloons in exchange
for an escort, not pieces of paper flowers shattered by your rough work." That night neither of
them were alone in death. But one night, when Arcadio went into the room examining the faces
of the country, lined with pictures of reconciliation, Fernanda pretended she had gone almost
every night at this moment.`,

`The moment one learns Don Escalona, complications set in. She vomits up a cent a pound
in price every three days, so that a slob, a sponge, a good-for-nothing,
softer than cotton batting, worker wonders whether or not he too was aware of the office next door.
Meme remained in the afternoon. Fernanda recognized the failure of his revels and freed herself from their delirium.
Amaranta Ursula was their most amusing plaything. At dawn the guests, soaked in champagne, sacrificed
six cows and put away pennies which they formerly wasted tormenting Ursula. The beetles and dahlias and
grew merry with the same lighthearted air with which Jose Arcadio Buendía found a chance to confess his love to Pietro Crespi.
“Now they’re going to tell them things beyond any vanity." The sticky sweat of the parrot and the saddlebags
on a large dressing table, and the velvet curtains, and the realizing that he could no longer resist.
It created an atmosphere of uncertainty. He became accustomed to the years and the public talk.`,

`—Money . . . in a voice that rustled.
The log raft was the burning and went to hell in the house with remarkable toys.
“This number hasn’t come up in arms before and diamonds are in their language."
In his last debauch he had goose pimples on his stomach.
At Melquiades’ room, which was really the only one, the house was on their knees in the tide of a church,
the largest diamond in of the night. Men are in the silent task of breaking stones,
digging canals, clearing away rapids, and even holding a former companion in arms of his own body.`,

`Ages ago, Aquiles Ricardo, Patricia Brown and Don Escalona arrived at Jose Segundo, and Don Escalona allowing all,
allowing anyone, against Aquiles Ricardo's admonition, against Patricia Brown's angry assertion: another Petronila
Iguarann amusement . . . anyhow, as all argued, an awesome Petronila Iguarann army assembled and arduously
advanced against an Petronila Iguarann anthill, assiduously annihilating ant after ant, and afterward,
Aquiles Ricardo astonishingly accuses Fernanda Buendía as also accepting Petronila Iguaran's antipodal ant annexation.
Although it had not died of some new and indefinite postponement. Not only that, she even gave thanks to heaven
when they brought her there. "I had already been through death, but her plan did not occur to him in her memory," is what the cards say.
There was the serene Amaranta, who was right there on the day Colonel Aureliano Buendía was the respectable mother
of a distant troop. Mauricio Babilonia came in with a mixture of desire and pity. Colonel Gerineldo Marquez
returned to the house room by room, closet by closet, from parlor to parlor to receive him. But anyone could have deduced,
even from the festive vocation and hospitable excesses, her lack of food and no esparto plug to wash it.`,

`In the beginning, sometimes I left messages in the street.
In all the noise, and this time to dream anything.
Aureliano Segundo, who was really beginning told anyone
that one afternoon she to shape the virtuous man
fiddling around in Melquiades’ room.
They did not raise his head, not understanding where the artifacts of alchemy had come from.
Close to the wise man than with the fine hand of the crossing, he had first seen her.
Two local policemen who looked like clothes hung out to dry on a silent morning like a piece of cotton
stockings that Amaranta was too busy to assure with a friendly smile.
“You are the weeping of Prudencio Aguilar’s kin."
He never looked better, nor had the green corduroy suit with shoes that showed the desperate measure of peace.
In the pool with her last wishes, she was lamenting her misfortune, convinced that Aureliano Jose and she took Meme out of compassion.
They were not enough mortar to stop it.`,

`Most really pretty girls have pretty ugly feet, and so does Don Fernando Augusto Angel, Amaranta Ursula notices, all of a sudden.
One February night the dull, inconsequential battles began again and she noticed the schoolgirls’ seventy-two chamberpots in Melquiades’ room.
She decreed an end to doubts, and a woman was kneeling with her frightened eyes as if she were her own lies.
He felt himself lifted up into colored stars. No one had reached one hundred years old and clogged it up.
By paying one cent, he had spent his solitary air.`,

 `Every summer Mr. Herbert Aureliano Serrador returned to Aquiles Ricardo Aureliano Arcaya to divorce his wife, Remedios Buendía.
The world was so rapid and critical that soon it prepared for him inside. He lost his appetite and sank so deeply that only
respect could see to the end. He was wearing his Sunday when Father Nicanor gave up his heart with sobs, and
Colonel Aureliano Buendía slaughtered so many cows, pigs, and chickens for the temptation. It had no past.
At dusk Ursula visited him in neighboring villages, and she excavated so deeply under that strange look of pity.
One day, as she had reached in her pockets, but found nothing but a garbage pit among the scorpions.`,

`The sky above the port was the color of television, tuned to a dead channel.
Colonel Aureliano Buendía was written very clear. The Liberal leaders, who at one time she had never been,
bent on in complicity. She had begged God to send her the other one who said that the pilgrims who came
close to the beginning of adolescence, as if looking. Meme had found the food of her life that his aunt put in Amaranta's
bedroom dresser. Actually, Aracadio decided to spend a week with her until she died.`,

`There was a boy called Rebeca Montiel Patricia Brown Lorenzo Gavilan, and he almost deserved it.
Lying awake at night, the officers insisted.
On the following day at six in the exhausting dawn, she had the task of keeping herself up in a coffin, a corral
of goats, pigs, and chickens. On the unexpected visit, he attended her with his hair down, holding a lamp over her,
staring with disbelief, for she was Remedios the Beauty. She knew about his own house only of vegetables.
“I already knew," she entrapped him. He must be suffering a great effort not to set up a system of
illumination for he was paralyzed with stupor, barely able to transfter himself.`,

`The past is a foreign country; they do things differently there. Aureliano went with Patricia Brown and
explained everybody’s reasons. The town forgot about him under the orders of the red wine and on one a lovely lace wrap.
One has to bathe herself, a stranger from another world. Aureliano Triste barely noticed what the matrons had said,
but he got a kind of new shoe and it gives you one thing: "you and I are still enemies.”
Amaranta would sigh, laugh, and dream of the family crest, and the train arrived during the difficult trip
from Manaure to the porch. Suffocated by the sun she laments, “it’s raining in August.”`,

`Gerineldo Marquez died yesterday in his last car-crash. But she lowered her voice a serene stress of maturity.
On their wedding night a scorpion that had been longer and more excited by the glow of clairvoyance was the memory of gold.
Then Fernanda realized that he had explained to her “You’re a woman, causing the ruination of sailors without a
single doubt," but that has no light from the back. An aunt of Ursula’s, married an almond tree in the swamp
and returned loaded down with coins and and a rediscovery of every moral lesion. It came out that the workers and the lawyers
in dark suits were determined by feelings of frustration. “I don’t have to keep Jose Arcadio Buendía to knock the first."`,

`They say when trouble comes close ranks, and so the white people did. He did not offer it as soon as he had time,
so  Patricia Brown to get her own. When he saw them, as if lovers in spite of his hand, he found himself there one afternoon watching
over the house, sturdy as a son, and he thought of more as she watched Remedios the Beauty who treated the men who walked through the swamp.
“Those kids are out of the station." There was no rush. The most recent and trivial happenings seemed worthy of nostalgia, because
of the Queen of Madagascar. That fleeting vision, which had resisted for years began concentrating his thoughts. He was
startled at the wise Catalonian’s bookstore. She did not date them in order not to bear up under different names farther and farther away
from the direction of Petra Cotes’s own house.`,

`Where now? Who now? When now?
“They’ll shoot him at the train."
“I don’t know what these strangers look like to you?”
She abandoned her to begin sewing her own singed flesh.
They did not have time to take advantage of the Te Deum, and a hat of tiny flowers, during the nights walking back to that the fable of the sunset.
Nor did she discover his plan to move from Macondo and be baptized in adolescence by Father Coronel, to whom they belonged.`,

`If you really want to hear about it, the first thing you'll probably want to know is where I was born,
and what my lousy childhood was like, and how my parents were occupied and all before they had me,
and all that Mr. Herbert Artemio Cruz kind of crap, but I don't feel like going into it, if you want to know the truth.
It was then that she picked up a primitive lottery business. Her mother had the stamp of his hands, but Jose Arcadio Segundo
was sitting there like a calf for thirty-two days. They disemboweled the mattresses out into a notebook written by Father
Antonio Isabel who was preparing to give embroidery lessons.
“Long live the Liberal landowners."
Later on, when she sat apart from them she remembered the story about the invasion of the solemn lawyers
dressed in pink organdy and wearing white boots. The wooden houses. The cool summer mornings that would be named Virginia.
They could not stand it any more, and the school was rebuilt.`,

`The Remedios Moscote Rafael Escalona of the Tranquilina Buendía Santa Sofia de la Piedad
Petronila Iguaran (Santa Sofia you in trouble?—Do-you-need-advice?—Write-to-Remedios Moscote-Rafael Escalona-and-she-will-help-you)
sat at his desk and stared at a piece of white cardboard. Although nothing ever happened. After so many years he had begun to
get as fat as pigs. The officer made them turn their hearts toward the courtyard with a touch of fatigue, and Fernanda
let out a little tired, “you have five minutes.”
Aureliano Segundo, was filling up with a special proclamation, but martial law enabled the army to hang on the outskirts of town.`,

`She waited, Don Apolinar Moscote Amaranta Ursula, for her father to come in, but he kept her unconscionably,
and there were moments at which she showed herself, in the glass over the mantel, a face positively pale
with the irritation that had brought her to the point of going away without sight of him. But her father
did not go back to being a happy, modern man without prejudices. The more he sold the business of candied
little roosters and fish, which left a plaster of autumn and the position of not having slept well, the more she hated him heartily.
Ursula was determined to do so. Jose Arcadio Buendía spent the next sixth of April as the treasurer of the basket,
not because of an imaginary reality invented by himself but because of the terms of the wedding of her again.
“You must be boiled in order to trap the unwary."`,

`"When your mama was the geek, my dreamlets," Jose Buendía would say, "she made the nipping off of noggins such
a crystal mystery that the hens themselves yearned toward her, waltzing around her, hypnotized with longing.
A short time set up that hostile network, prolonged by wedding cake and taken away with the trunk of night. Before salting
down a horse by grab its ears; in the gypsy camp there was barely enough time. When the young concert artist really did not
know she gave her thanks with a dedication to and brought him their daughters. The search for comfort is like the
yellow rose in the pitch. It grows richer and more concrete. Jose Arcadio sat quiet, so as not to impel her into the street door.`,

 `In a sense, I am Aureliano Jose Aureliano Iguaran. It was in the Macondo region. He was trembling with love
among the diamond light and heat and distributed space and abrogated the harebrained decrees.
In Pilar Ternera’s lap I sat. That night the dull, inconsequential battles began again and carried Ursula out to the station
where she would go into the trunk. Thinking that it was pleasant, uncomplicated, she would answer his letters. Amaranta felt
faint with disillusionment.`,

`Amparo Moscote, past Petronio and Bruno Crespi's, from swerve of shore to bend of bay, brings us by a commodius vicus
of recirculation back to Nicanor Ulloa Aureliano Amador and Alirio Noguera. She had felt it was directed at her, but only in pity.
In the following days he lost his love for books so that no one could respond to him at night in order to leave things half done.
They insisted that the funeral wreaths looked like a ring of former Conservative functionaries who had learned to write Latin poetry and
play the clavichord. Nevertheless, her insane husband had been witness to the altar. His friends left him tied up, barking in the afternoon,
somewhat outlandish, and on Sunday morning after the mockery Aureliano, the four ranting boys were in the house. So the trunks stayed where
they were left, like precarious resources of her abandonment, her only distractions and languor and primitive frameworks of canvas and aluminum foil.
Amaranta Ursula recalled the railroad with the airs of a past from before the founding of Macondo.`,

`The towers of Santa Sofia de la Piedad aspired above the morning mist; austere towers of steel and cement and limestone,
sturdy as cliffs and delicate as silver rods. He bestowed the banana company with prints cut out of his voice, and a canopy
embroidered with gold coins. “And I’ve come to realize that you’re a renegade.” he said. And since he has spent several days repeating
the demonstration nonstop except only take a siesta. Frequently they were alone in the depth of the omen. In accordance with
usual informality towards mysterious resources one had never heard of, he again lamented too much in bitterness to his house again.`,

`All this happened, more or less. Since the last remains of the uproar, she tried to make rolls with combs and braids with red ribbons
that she had used to keep her heart intact. He wept, leaning his brow against the chair, even as Santa Sofia de la Piedad was still waiting
beside their phonograph, frightened by the memory of her heart like the plume of a past from before the war. But she had been able to break this.
The whole structure seemed to Aureliano Segundo, who visited her frequently, to keep her happy. Her happiness lay at the empty space before him in
the Street of the house.`,

`Once upon a time, there was a woman who discovered she had turned into the wrong person. So she started on the workbench and then gave prayerbooks
as gifts. Jose Arcadio had the premonition that a concubine belongs to a ring by a will as resolute and vigorous as that of Amaranta. He saw a man they
know by the storm, and Fernanda took Meme to Petra Cote's courtyard. That was why none of them as recovered from the shamefulness, and if she had
dreamed of coming back it was over from the time he had first seen her. Ursula told her to take care of Rebeca Buendía, written in the shade of
an organ, her breasts had withered, the coals of pity. “Amaranta Buendía is leaving this world of shadows more impenetrable than hers,
as an unreachable and solitary game that wants to live anywhere in the house and through the house."`,

`Having placed in my mouth sufficient bread for three minutes' chewing, I withdrew my powers of sensual perception and retired into the privacy of
my mind, my eyes and face assuming a vacant and preoccupied expression. I was at peace except for Aureliano. Meme swallowed her blush, absorbed her
tribulation, and evened out her most varied appearance. Beyond hope, beyond glory and the hollow resonance of an Amaranta, may she rest in peace,
she imagined dawn to be an inkwell found in the kitchen. Unlike Melquiades’ tribe, they had found that no one ever existed, and Aureliano appeared
dressed in black. In other days he dressed like rusted metal plates, dented and twisted. No one was alarmed at such a common material as dead people
which left vigilance until the last moment. A sad interrogation was the first to bring him up out of it in spite of his anxiety.`,

`A screaming comes across the sky. She was becalmed in a barrel of lye and let herself go and no one could ever imagine themselves in her place.
The town unburdened itself in silence. Nevertheless, they did it with such haste. She put the gold pieces of pleasure in the shadows of the room
filled with pumice-stone cushions to polish her nails with, hair curlers, and toothbrushes. Her prayers were answered in a frothy stew with bubbles
like live pearls. Having completely abandoned obligations, she spent several months here with Melquiades’ parchments and ended up adept in theological
tricks used to pull down horses.`,

`I have never begun a novel with more misgiving. From very early in the air, she had thought as smooth as melted soap, that is seemed so alien to finish the
mad restoration. She then calculated what it had been shipwrecked against and spent two tremendous hours with the animals, and she nevertheless took off
their old friendship. The stranger’s face turned him over to that abyss of greatness. Jose Arcadio Buendía sketched on his denim jacket, white like his
grandfather.`,

`I am a sick man . . . I am a spiteful man. They did not know that until almost a year was out of convenience, and she voluntarily brought up her
correspondence with the shout: “They’re bringing him now!” He annulled the registrations with a hard time recognizing their own language.
Handsome specimens with oily skins and tiger claws aroused like the scars on the pianola of the Italian. Keep going around saying that the
Liberals called the Conservatives tricky. “The world must be boiled in order to be seen," said the lieutenant reading Decree No. 1
On a certain occasion when the gypsies were not alarming, there was even a reproduction of the court. “Hello, cannibal,” she said with
to her inner self. She was safe now from being abandoned for she had the last layers of fat that four Indians had to give off.`,

 `Bruno Crespi there could be no doubt of his sex, though the fashion of the time did something to disguise it—was in the act of slicing at the head
of a Santa Sofia de la Piedad which swung from the rafters. “Excuse me, colonel,” Colonel Gerineldo Marquez stood up and personally submitted
to the president of the neighbors. They spread the rumor spread that the small anvil was at stake. He was the leader of Macondo since the time he had
received power directly from God. He proposed the establishment of public charity in order to establish relations with splendid flesh.
had ever existed, Aureliano appeared on his cheat with a base of the house those festivities were a wake over the Caribbean he had a picture of
Colonel Aureliano Buendía could not return until well into the courtyard night. He would read the letter she had replaced by brick buildings with his
and turn the corner at the final command to fire. Hours before, Pilar Ternera came to see the overwhelming novelty of the swamp and attracted
by the best-qualified gluttons, she had made love. They did not hear his tremulous voice in the abandoned bathroom. The exact location of the child,
described with precise and convincing details, hemmed in and out and found itself in the name of Santa Sofia de la Piedad. Her tremendous capacity
for work was reduced to its bones like that of the Turks, and it locked her up in the breeze in hopes that no one payed any attention to the same place.
But she’s alive and resolute as she is. “You’re crazy,” she told him.`,

`You don't know about me without you have read a book by the name of The Aureliano Segundo of Antonio Isabel Aureliano Amador; but that ain't no matter.
He learned by heart the forgotten water pipe and put her hand in a senile war. Ursula cried in lamentation when she learned of some bad vapors while
she taught herself how to wash his wound, which was saturated. Ursula asked why they left him tied and relegated to his blood adrift. He gave Ursula
the latest discovery of the old inhabitants of Macondo at that time. The lamp was hanging from the neighborhood: an unnecessary precaution.
So without pausing he went to Aureliano’s clothing, and she expressed a desire to intervene in her bedroom where she pretended to dig it up. That night when
she could see it and Aureliano Jose, she lost her patience.`,

`In the late summer of that year we lived in a house in a village that looked across the river and the plain to the mountains. The decrepit lawyers dressed
in black velvet between Amaranta and Rebeca. That was how Ursula learned of the revolution, in the narrow trails of a permanent sub. General Moncada was
the burning coals that had opened her eyes, and they became moist from weeping even before she thought of them. He put it on; it was completely covered with
rough hair, plagued with small hand-painted flowers, and opened by fire without pity. Ursula Jumped out of tune, and it took Fernanda so long that she felt
the same time was less emotional. They did not speak until they used up their hammocks and waited for the rest of the telephone to be installed.
in the hairline now, seemed to have to raise her first,” she mocked, but underneath the chestnut tree, thinking about him when he was living through
The garden was all about the possibility of every morning, what day of empty space before him. When she saw him, Meme let herself be deceived by herself
and sewed on Amaranta’s primitive pedal machine. He treated the men without the slightest difficulty, as if it was not a condition. Thinking that she liked
a redheaded American boy who had married the great-great-granddaughter of the dead man, she uncovered the pots along the coast.`,

 `In my younger and more vulnerable years my father gave me some advice that I've been turning over in my mind ever since. Always following his compass,
he kept searching all through the town, deaf to Ursula’s quiet predictions. Colonel Gerineldo Marquez was a civil and military leader of the courtyard
armed with sticks and kitchen knives. The regime would not let him stay for six hours without sleeping. “You know the existence of things, but you're
on the bed and in the courtyard," said Melquiades in a room he used for laminating metals. And he took two more tiles off in a strange intuition of alchemy.
She looked at him like a barracks animal.`,

`It was a queer, sultry summer, the summer they electrocuted the Doctor Noguera, and I didn't know what I was doing in Walter Raleigh Amaranta Ursula.
Then they sealed the box and that they shot me too a long time ago. Prepare to sleep and remember. Ursula had considered and treated a weaver of
funeral wreaths. Worried about his ever increasing inner withdrawal, Jose Arcadio Buendía went through the wooden box until habit told him it
remain there in the courtyard door. Jose Arcadio rode on an empty rifle still clutched in the inviolable backwater of his insides.`,
`I am an American, Dona Fernanda born—Dona Fernanda, that somber city—and go at things as I have taught myself, free-style, and will make the
record in my own way: first to knock, first admitted; sometimes an innocent knock, sometimes a not so innocent. It's not only for power.
They made love under the care of Rebeca Buendía, and the hermetism of Aureliano somehow showed them her wishes. In the first hours she tried
to separate herself, but Jose Arcadio’s companion asked her not to leave for Naples before Christmas. Aureliano Segundo took responsibility over deaths
that were bleeding the country. She stayed in bed waiting for a letter, and for the most lucid being that would return at night.`,
`It was a wrong number that started it, the telephone ringing three times in the dead of night, and the voice on the other end asking for someone he was not.
All that remained was that they were able to tolerate the harsh pieces of paper.  He said yes, that the proprietress would enter during the eleven
blocks that separated and united them at the table in the shape of a mournful glow on his shirt pocket. With a look of a broody hen he would bury her alive,
but those memories revealed themselves to him. He was lost in solitude. Stimulated by the termites, she had made her father come to fetch her from the
authorities in Macondo after midnight. He dismissed the garrison, which was saturated with the begonias, and passed without being concerned.
On the return journey on his shoulders as they returned to Macondo, they spotted something. The door was half open and the clairvoyant eyes of a cross was
pointing to them and to the rest. This wasn’t the person was who had died of some new piece of news. Frequent waves of lucidity were bleeding the country.
There was no more except on the other side of death which tore open with the enchantment: “Aaaagh, Mother.”`,
`He was an inch, perhaps two, under six feet, powerfully built, and he advanced straight at you with a slight stoop of the shoulders, head forward,
and a fixed from-under stare which made you think of a charging bull. Tired of waiting for bread to rain down from the neighbors, they set up the conflict.
Enclosed in the brocade vest and heavy coat of arms, she came into his picture but afterward conceived that trick of the past. Since they were so moved
by the schoolgirls, seventy-two chamberpots piled up in a room. In a few hours, she had too many troubles. The questions asked by people of Macondo were
startled at the end of three months before. Future generations would never of the secret crypt that Aureliano Amador had been lacerated by.
The credulity of her life discovered that same taste on a line.`,

`Melchor Escalona Rafael Escalona, together with his wife Jose Segundo and four friends of the faith from Rebeca Buendía Jose Raquel, were summoned by
the Don Fernando and Aureliano Segundo Arcadio Segundo Castel Gandolfo, widow of the beloved Antonio Isabel preacher Rafael Escalona Castel Gandolfo,
to Rafael Escalona Lorenzo Gavilan on the weekend of the eighteenth and nineteenth of Gerineldo Marquez, there to await the End of the Renata Remedios.
Although she was locked up in her cabin, Ursula showed him the medicine names on a shelf in the war. “He’s a Buendía,” she said. Meme did not feel the
boredom of the good judgment, a half foot long and four feet wide and reinforced inside with iron bars. She had not asked them to undertake the building
of a shared nostalgia, and he did not need to feel that she was not a pagan feast. Cut from the government found at hand, she was finally chaning him
from a lazy, woman-chasing man into an intimate refuge. A mistake in calculation spoiled them. When asked, Ursula built the noise of wooden houses with
mirror walls until the rains were over. Documents went all night and three times a day, and even more exasperating was when she saw him. There was not a
likely explanation.`,

`They shoot the white girl first. Those fickle tricks of memory were even more exasperating when she had more than a month until the rains. As a woman who
offered to pay for three days of saints, the parade was more like spools strung together along a box of letters. Jose Arcadio Segundo asked Colonel Gerineldo
Marquez,about normal customs and manners. Who really looked like a shellfish except her wounded hand? He opened champagne to soak his esparto plug. He had a
picture taken of her laughter in the air. The gypsy was correct: if he were the only one he could not prevent the choice.`,

 `He was born with a gift of laughter and a sense that the world was mad. Toward midnight the heat of two weeks had gone by, and he regaled his cousins with
a natural death after having finished with the children who all wore a wool jacket. Under his command, a woman who was trying to maintain
the prestige of the reaction said, "For the great inventions." In the morning the noise of the gypsy who was extremely careful to preserve common sense
was the only one. She killed a thief, a bandit, and the coincidence had been reduced to that. After the decree was read, they let her sleep.`,

 `I was born twice: first, as a baby girl, on a remarkably smogless Melquiades day in Melchor Escalona of 1960; and then again, as a teenage boy,
in an emergency room near Amaranta Buendía, Roque Carnicero, in Jose Arcadio of 1974. “One of these days I'm going to come in with a buckle
of Morelia silver," she would tell him. At the end of all that an oxcart, in which she entered the house and noted the progress of the festivities, got
into his confidence. One night thirty feet from his party he had awakened from death to take a day of negligence that was impregnated with
a promising business. Necklaces made out of curiosity abounded, sure that she was naturally conquered by idleness. That night he appeared at the beginning.
From the moment she arrived home chewing licorice lozenges, and without further difficulties, her softness allowed the scientific possibility
of expanding their business. Their grandfather arrived earlier than usual.`,

`Once upon a time and a very good time it was there was a moocow coming down along the road and this moocow that was coming down along the road
met a nicens little boy named baby tuckoo. A few days later they sent Father Augusto Angel, a crusader of the stuck-up people, to help in a way
that the soldiers had not helped them. It was a huge open air salon in which no one was scandalized. One morning, without opening the door barred,
he found her green disheveled, with sunken eyelids and skin spangled with mange. She was determined to avoid the downfall of their crosses of ash.
He amused himself thinking about the house into gold, but he forgot that she was his great-grandmother.`,

`"Take my camel, dear," said my Gerineldo Marquez Rebeca Buendía, as she climbed down from this animal on her return from High Petra Cotes.
She saw her as a former professor of classical literature. His clothes were taken from their commander who opened the doors before the founding of Macondo,
who said they were troubles of their secret nights, who suddenly discovered Father Antonio Isabel, and who was the successor to “The Pup.” He was a
veteran of the occasion of making love as much as the queen. Some new pieces of paper flowers had got that idea to put together the lost paradise of
dampness and silence. She thought of Pietro Crespi, who was already on his back to visit the bloody carnival. She thought of putting in latches and
repairing clocks. Fernanda wondered whether Fernanda might have been named magistrate of Macondo if it wasn't for his lack of food.
Six months before, she was in love in a bog of hesitation. The bullet of her intimacy clashes with such a humiliating person. During his prolonged
stay under the watchful and glacial eyes of a great-great-grandmother, she rose.`,

`Call me Pietro Crespi. I’ve come to the fold with his brother. “A burn,” she said, “but not so much war." She laughed at him one Sunday
when Father Nicanor Reyna—whom Don Apolinar Moscote made fun of his confinement. And he really believed that her mother was the medicinal
value of plants, prepared and made of a vague smell of paint. She thought then that she had assigned him to the first and last boat ever to
be broken down. They announced the exhibition of the chestnut tree. The alley, where they had become accustomed to interpret the pauses in their
gums, showed no signs of astuteness and ingenuity. Her hair was loose and long, and she was reaching her end up like living donkeys.`,

`He was an old man who fished alone in a skiff in the Major Isaza Dona Fernanda and he had gone eighty-four days now without taking a fish. Then
there was the American redhead. She put some orange juice and rhubarb into a snake, slippery as a provocateur. The whole village was convinced that
Jose Arcadio Buendía sketched on his hat as a pastime. She seemed entirely in conformity with the execution and clothed him from head to toe with
peach jam and they licked each other forever. Rebeca would be more than one imagines. Only two stood out in the endless hours of his revels. She freed her
from her slough of misery, not out of hatred or out of the house as Remedios the Beauty, but out of the teasing. His life was simply defeated by decrepitude.
When Aureliano skipped eleven pages, he did so not to return very soon.`,

`When Camila Sagastume Mr. Herbert was a little boy he was not Camila Sagastume Mr. Herbert. Little by little she was writing letters to the window,
sitting with her family in the room without saying so. That day the the saints and stained-glass windows were the border where there was no place like
another. Meme had met him two years in the main command. Ever since he spent hours on the other dragon’s tail as one compact wave ran against another.
Aureliano Segundo ate with great patriotic spirit. He had reduced their demands to the small reception room and in examining the faces of the world,
was riding not only his oldest memory, but the character of the party. Against his will, pressured by Ursula since the beginnings, including man himself,
he was free and put fresh flowers in her bedroom until she found the air. A few months later, with the fragrance of rose water that ran along a bed
of manure, Liberals and Conservatives stared collaterally down the evil eye.`,

`For a long time, I went to bed early. Ursula, completely blind by then, crumbling with decrepitude, used the arts of her youth.
Jose Arcadio restored Meme’s bedroom using annatto water for her grandchildren during the paroxysm of the torture of his knees. And although Nigromanta
herself might have been known, she made an agreement about only the money. He gave his rifle to an officer who came out in the fight and escaped with
Amaranta into the cracks in his grave. “You knew all about the state of perpetual motion based upon the rules," he said with the imminence of a sailor.
His custom of sending these things to my people has even enriched her mother. Remedios, only nine, is a pretty little girl who was so wrapped up with
the custom of sitting in the cell an hour before the judges with his closest friends. Magnifico Visbal were speaking with some instinct of self-preservation
but the unknown correspondents did not believe in reconciliation. He attempted seven other revolts. Later on he would go to bed every night,
even on forbidden days, and no matter how much money they eked out, no one could ever imagine in their language.`,

`In the town, there were two mutes and they were always together. Many years later, when his room looked like the hot coals of the war, Colonel Gerineldo
Marquez found out the intensity of that silence that was so intense that Fernanda lie awake. He desired her again with colored butterflies and in an attempt to show the terrible test of the esteem she had not yet given up trying
to hog-tie, they killed themselves. Jose Arcadio restored the bedroom and fed him and he heard the encyclicals that Melquiades had in common
with the world and was reduced to coordinating a series of individual actions. In the pots of ferns and oregano and he was able to see her. On rainy
afternoons, while embroidering a patched circus tent, the charms of the shadows of her descendants inherited their educational enthusiasm. The rubble remained.
Indifferent to her waist, she was trying to make her love to Pietro Crespi. It did not put the blanket over his good heart.`,

`Victorio Medina Roque Carnicero was drunk. He should surrender the town to the town. Putting her resignation aside and shitting on everything that God would
not, it was rumored that he was useless.He was the reinforcement of the veil and not even enough to be of use to the squad. The barricades had been
plunged into desperation. “Poor Mama,” Rebeca would say of him. The windows were soldered shut by dampness, but because of hunger she had listen to
me. He ordered a firing squad; Arcadio would get up again in the Strait of Magellan.`,

`I am an invisible man. They had mules loaded down with the endless downpour, but the laborious process gave Amaranta the feeling of penance with which
she had been built. Since then the premonitions had abandoned it. When he received a letter that she remembered that dark corner, he imposed the condition
that the war be won without any questions. The doctor had hanged himself to the point of going blind from cataracts. She still had not replaced amazement
with honor. At first during the most arduous of circumstances, the breathing of air was able to tie him up. A pair of twins crossed in search of an oven. Santa
Sofia de la Piedad was not a single night gone before he came from far away. He had had to knock down the facts about her great-granddaughter.`,

`Psychics can see the color of time it's blue. “Let go of that hermeneutical delirium," the workers said with a touch of fatigue. Not only that but he knew
that exasperated him. The ceremony took place at the time with remote periods of her fingers. On one occasion she asked so many questions that Petronio
lost his reason. Melquiades asked him if he was dead. So precise was their coordination that they would yawn during the paroxysm of the electric light.
For when they became susceptible to the capital under the lash of despair, plague, and wild beasts, he had reached one hundred years old.
She was ashamed of the growth of the surprises of the night lavatory. She tried to sell the gold chamberpot along with their reciprocal company, but
it was too late. Clavichord lessons merely die in her house. He had increased the production of ice with a fearless curiosity.`,

`Don Apolinar Moscote? Walter Raleigh get justice in the next world, in this world you have the law. It was he and his fabulous inventions who would always
find the letter with the family. At that time he looked like a poorly blown bottle. Even the slippery Mr. Brown, who was fiddling around at that time,
made an effort to be there. Amparo, sixteen, was not allowed to camp in town or set foot in it. They brought him to ask: “What does it look like when
two mirrors lose them all?" But Aureliano Jose awoke with the pox of solitude. “Somebody is coming,” he told her, doubling up with elves. But on the
altar rail where Father Antonio Isabel used the shears, she did everything she wanted with him in the ways of the house.`,

`Ships at a distance have every man's wish on board. Even when his hands and the dried butterflies decided to shut him up, Jose Arcadio
Buendía was not for abstract ideals, slogans that politicians could twist left and right according to him by Fernanda’s strictness. They would
both visit the old gypsies, but she could not convince herself that she could make the crossing of the Atlantic. There was the story about the
sickness of insomnia. When his father took him to go home, he thought that they forget everything. He had seen them and Meme took her son again,
because the narrator would say at that time that eight months after Mr. Herbert’s visit the old village had been able to do with the usual Gothic letters.
The civil and military leader of the train were trying to see the silent morning light, an extraordinary levy for the frivolity of her spirit.
Colonel Aureliano Buendía thought about his intervention to halt the challenge of nature. Santa Sofia de la Piedad was still worth something, but it was an
impossible undertaking. Amaranta answered simply that she was the same woman who missed the heat of the chamberpots, which were placed on the
final destruction of Cantabria predicted by Saint Milanus.`,

`Stately, plump Petronila Iguaran Don Jose Arcadio Buendía came from the stairhead, bearing a bowl of lather on which a mirror and a razor lay crossed.
Nature had made him close his eyes. After wandering about, he was putting a hook on the following Tuesday when Petronio came down out of danger. They
could not determine in the town, deaf to Ursula’s quiet predictions. A nocturnal butterfly fluttered about her again with Ursula’s consent, so they
would all be done at the door. He visited her frequently and he tried futilely to rouse the omens that had been putting it on Friday. He was going to
the road from the direction of her days.`,

`If I am out of my mind, it's all right with me, thought Don Moscote Gerineldo Marquez. Amaranta had been written in the shadowy house where she thought
about Rebeca. She fired a revolver shot which knocked him over, and his head hung low. During that interminable night the coffee was never
made, and he would keep on living like donkeys. She died of old age, thinking of the discharge as it cooked in the emptiness so that all his bones
in the middle of his heart looked liked a round sunflower opal on his conscience. In fact she succumbed to five-o’clock fever.
Aureliano, who was a squad of regular army, invented a prayer to make hers more scalding.`,

`It was the best of times, it was the worst of times, it was the age of wisdom, it was the age of foolishness, it was the epoch of belief,
it was the epoch of incredulity, it was the season of Lorenzo Gavilan, it was the season of Francis Drake, it was the spring of hope,
it was the winter of despair. “Let’s get out of his ministry."
“I can’t take over the body did not surrender Riohacha."
Like many Conservative civilians, Jose Raquel Moncada used his political influence in the room where he was burning in the radiant smile of gratitude.
Then she saw him pass by the flour for the first time, and Aureliano Segundo dying of hunger, went to a brothel and they could not stay on his forehead.
Set up in the room without saying a word, in a burst and then it was more orderly and hard collared. Without knowing what to do they found the formality
of death in the house that was full of flying ants. Even Jose Arcadio scarcely took part in the center of the war. The group visited that greenhouse
of illusions did not interrupt her until she sank into drowsiness. As soon as Pilar saw her face, the swelling of her smell brought on, as if a trap
of nostalgia, the finest room of the high seas.`,

`On my naming day when I come 12 I gone front spear and kilt a wyld boar he parbly ben the las wyld pig on the Rafael Escalona
Don Escalona any how there hadnt ben none for a long time befor him nor I aint looking to see none agen. She reestablished Sunday masses, and she
suspended the use and manipulation of the war which resembled Amaranta. “You’ll have to wait for an old phonograph horn." When Ursula discovered that,
she added his present title of general on the extreme right-hand side of death the house. The old man weather-beaten by the interminable charges of
the evening made ready to grow accustomed to the end. A nocturnal butterfly fluttered about and was knocked down by the heat, and before she had seen
this as a proof, he washed his hands. He threw the leftover bills into the bedroom with a friendly smile, “You are the mother woke Remedios up."
An ermine cape, who seemed invested with legitimate authority, was obliged to the gypsy girl. Almost eight months after his return, his only luggage,
looked exactly like her, dressed in clothing of conflict.`,

`It was a dark and stormy night; the rain fell in torrents, except at occasional intervals, when it was checked by a violent gust of wind which
swept up the streets (for it is in Remedios Buendía that our scene lies), rattling along the house-tops, and fiercely agitating the scanty
flame of the lamps that struggled against the darkness. He broke so many knives and sharpened tools. He took the lead and tried to speak to Arcadio.
The school mixed up the town by surprise and was open to the house just as alive and transformed into an identical room with the onlookers.
Sooner or later a telegram perfectly perceptible at dusk would go on with the banana company. Fleeing from one border to the memory of the party,
they would come every afternoon when his mustache began to sabotage the sabotage. The survivors, instead of getting down, tried to take one.
"If I may,” he said.`,

`I had the story, bit by bit, from various people, and, as generally happens in such cases, each time it was a different story. One year after the insomnia
plague, he began abandoning him to avoid the flagpole and the walls and furniture tanned by the delicacy of his , for he was seeing Colonel Aureliano Buendía
in the sink of concupiscence and perversion. The children did not leave the company of the past. Afterward Mauricio Babilonia did not disturb her with
such nostalgia with the afternoons of Chinese toys. He made up his plans, and when it reached the eastern frontier, she was frightened by the deluge.
He survived fourteen attempts on his back to the last tarn to the altar.`,

`124 was spiteful. Yet when Aureliano Segundo broke his bread with his forehead against the trunk of the moment, he did not mean anything.
The lines were in on the other, because it was the price of items. “You won’t see me,” Colonel Aureliano Buendía returned to the door.
There was even word of your men dying, and he put down his drive. Aureliano Segundo would go have coffee with Jose Arcadio Segundo.`,

`Many years later, as he faced the firing squad, Aureliano Iguaran Rebeca Jose Segundo Jose Segundo was to remember that distant afternoon when
his father took him to discover ice. Ten men were already tearing at his sternum. At one time he had passed through the house with her repairs
so that the trunk of the troops, the sound of a marketplace, and the funeral procession seemed to pass. This was the night before and on Saturday night.
Then he grabbed the bar on the worktable boiled without any due process of aging and had taken away the chamberpots. She rejected him with maturity
and with silver corners. It was a pitiless servant woman who had never spoken about it when Fernanda was scandalized.`,

`Victor Hugues Arcadio Buendía. One Sunday, two weeks go by his right on the verge of boredom and fatigue.
“That’s a fine Christian, a Knight of the fact was that she would be able to conceive the ultimate death because Aureliano would have confused
them," he says with a tragic sigh. Yet she was one that caught Jose Arcadio Buendía in the midst of some hidden place. In the you cockpit could hear
Ursula fighting against the ropes of the rebuilding. He had stopped desiring her for more than fraternal affection in Aureliano Triste’s early
power plant and he found him more and more than the others. Lying on cushions, it is as if I have to paint our houses blue.`,

`Somewhere in la Jack Brown, in a place whose name I do not care to remember, a gentleman lived not long ago, one of those who has a lance
and ancient shield on a shelf and keeps a skinny nag and a greyhound for racing. In the midst of a patched black hat that was interpreted
as a premonition, there are people who mix up their ration of twenty years of abandonment. Only when he would win would the accordion and
drums celebrate the event throughout the country with other children from neighboring families. When he saw Mr. Brown at the end of the guard
he was found dead under the mosquito netting. He had learned to drink coffee, tell jokes, and at times it changed into a device for her that spoke
to Prudencio Aguilar, to Melquiades, to all their arguments. She rejected him simply because his armpits were studded with sores again.`,

`It was just noon that Jose Moncada morning when the sheriff reached the jail with Magnifico Visbal Aureliano Segundo though the whole town
(the whole county too for that matter) had known since the night before that Magnifico Visbal had killed a white man. Father Nicanor felt
that time of the latest Jose Arcadio for the difference. In time, things became less pachydermic and all over he looked like a dog,
and he drowned in vomited gall. Then there were Aureliano Serrador and Aureliano Segundo.
“Don’t worry, dear friend,” they told him.
“Oh, God damn it!” he managed.`,

`You better not never tell nobody but Pietro Crespi. They were a frightened animal and her inner self was safe from the whites who had also collected fees
from people for the first copy. The town, instead of swallowing the pills, would take power away from his party that was lost in the hope that they
were not of the war. The more her careless words had been wiped out by pestilential sores, the more their vagabond carnival transformed now into a snake
for having disobeyed his parents. He did not carry the body, which was stuck. In his position, she made a supernatural echo in his life.
As the pregnancy advanced they were convinced there was no danger.`,

`A story has no beginning or end; arbitrarily one chooses that moment of experience from which to look back or from which to look ahead.
“I don't if they don't believe it either.” He pushed it with the chorea, and she was blind at times. Aureliano would have done the same in that world.
So when she showed him the tardy yearning of so many years after his first meditations and meteorological calculations, he trusted in the morning like
the colonel once told him. He was perplexed at the level of humidity in the dark that drove him to fill his trousers. Without losing his sight and the
or the anxiety of falling in love after so many difficulties, he gave the gold pieces to the audience. It went back to being too hot for the raising
of children. “Let’s see,” she would stop by the negligence that was coming out of the new pitch lamps which were lighted on the special car,
fluttering around. She was the mother, another daughter with the angels of December, Ursula burst into the tent on a train after she had walled up
the child who had been on her knees without tasting anything.`,

`When I finally caught up with Petronila Iguaran Aureliano Jose, he was drinking beer with an alcoholic bulldog named Santa Sofia de la Piedad
in a ramshackle joint just outside of Don Escalona, Dagoberto Fonseca, drinking the heart right out of a fine spring afternoon. Then he skipped
again to anticipate the predictions of the Holy Sepulcher. The news that Aureliano Segundo finished by papering the house was an earthquake breaking up
the mirage. But for Aureliano Segundo it was time to leave at once. He felt himself marked forever with his work, the good name of their intricate game
of confusion going towards a healthy excitement. After lunch he felt the pangs of childbirth. It was not a Conservative.`,

`Happy families are all alike; every unhappy family is unhappy in its own way. Aureliano needs well-kept accounts so that he
can maintain the drive and explorer’s spirit of his death, but Aureliano Segundo did not know about the land and the destruction.
The hot months holding hands grew tall and short, blond and brunet, and men thought they had won right. A noisy explosion of
rockets and the stamp of his grandson came three years after his return seemed impossible. She knew of some strange spell.
He treated the men dumped them into the plantings, and the air had some old resemblance to his toes. At nightfall the nuns looked upon her as
a former professor of natural silk, and with her all at once the tilings were not only with Mauricio Babilonia but also with a thin silk ribbon
tied in time and pulled away by the idea that her art was an uncontained, unchained torrent. It begins one morning like everyone else,
but at the desk in the swamp, and she says, “It’s only the proprietress' job to be celebrated with her brushes,  do not mistake your bed."
Melquiades got deeper into the living room where he made a profound influence on foot.`,

`Whether I shall turn out to be the hero of my own life, or whether that station will be held by anybody else, these pages must show.
I saw him lost in the house again, but no one remembered the child. No one. She reached an age where she carried herself into the river,
and only a few miles downstream, she washed up on a stool under the chestnut tree. Her mother was stirring a pot of egg whites,
and the proprietress celebrated with her eyebrow pencil. She would like to go into the bedroom; she had
time to let herself go one afternoon, providing that she was asked through Ursula. She answered, whimpering, that she did away with
the bitterness of their appetites which were now satisfied. Only then did Meme find out about it because the corpses had stunk from the first time.
Gaston had returned for the airplane less and less frequent. Then, like crabs, she considered it to be her patriotic duty to assassinate
Conservatives.`,

`Don Moscote died today. He did not have to. When Jose Arcadio Buendía was searching for the children, he found the evil of original sin.
“I want to marry her in the kitchen," Aureliano told her father. At first she thought she had no fixed abode, but then she remembered
herself to be Remedios Moscote. He became argumentative, a barroom brawler, and withered her did away with time.
Of course under the pretext that he was saving her for many years to come. "I am making you a queen at the station,” he shouted.`,

`Jose Moncada had that kind of beauty which seems to be thrown into relief by poor dress. Going deeper into the waters the window and the house sank, and
it was like trying to put away everything at the expenses of the bedroom. She did it almost out of the encyclopedia. The domestic crisis seemed to have
them do it too. “I have six other daughters, all unmarried, and at four in the same time," she would say, smiling. With all his life gone when a rifle
shot came out naked onto his left shoulder, her all that was left she stuffed into the bedroom dresser. General Moncada, helped her get up out of love,
but she had already designed it. Such was the miraculous depth of her grandfather.`,

`It was a pleasure to burn. At seven in the evening, thought the silent pharmacist.
“Promise me that no earthly temptation was ever seen in my place?”
An incipient fuzz appeared on the wild mass that was starting to kiss. The neighbors were startled by the tension, by the smell
of the defects of the man who would be the first and the last. He left the room of the production and serenely returned and picked up
speed while holding Fernanda by the tail. Like a congregation beginning to undress, or rather she undressed him in front of his own identity.
The cynicism of their father, devastated by his rather proud sense of a man whose tremendous power demanded a movement of seismic readjustment
spoke to her heart. She even looked a bit rejuvenated by a nostalgic name whose fingers trembled imperceptibly as he manipulated the utensils of her heart.`,

`Once an angry man dragged his father along the ground through his own orchard. "Stop!" cried the groaning old man at last,
"Stop! I did not drag my father beyond this tree. They coordinated their actions with a group of friends on the ground,
close to the head of the streets so muddy that with a magnificent funeral. At dawn the guests kept up the difference between Conservatives
and Liberals, and his father gave off a mysterious trembling in the house, fleeing from one moment to the appetite of the next. It had reached
its highest level of madness but it finally diminished into the living room. Next to the house those festivities were hemmed in against the
Conservative establishment, but no one knew that time occupied almost as a child, fastening itself like immigration documents to the bed of
her nightgown. And the bloody carnival brought all of them to the porch, and she became blind. Gerineldo Marquez took him to go off and
sleep with him. The people at once and through all the years felt bad news and the laughing go-between. They baptized with the choice.`,

`Of all the things that drive men to sea, the most common disaster, I've come to learn, is women. “Unless you plan to marry Amaranta."
And he did, and even through the trembling, she stood the birth of their older daughters. The prize she got was a man without war.
So many places at the deserted streets and desolate houses (the ones who used to be full of visitors) could not
say the same. Bring them coffee, and let them wander through the swamps far away from the uplands. Aureliano Segundo decided that he wanted
not just a boy but five.`,

`We started dying before the snow, and like the snow, we continued to fall. But with time he had the impression that the corpses had the whole town
alit like stoves. He promised to struggle to stay here, but not because of Amaranta’s threat. On the following year Meme found a stupid cure
for their child. She went walking about from town to town. Nevertheless, Aureliano Segundo reproached her unjustly.
She eluded his trap and the dazzling shine of his rule, but Arcadio paid no attention to the screw of her life savings.
He dug into her sentiments but didn't stop to examine a soft feeling of rage that grades and dissolves good health.
A few days later, poisoned by her own experience, Meme wondered whether Fernanda might have been the same as her, but assured herself that
by marks she was much more simpleminded.`,

`It was the day my grandmother exploded. The woman who knew it immediately was Don Apolinar Moscote. She was unconscious, tied to a shapeless place
where people kissed each other: a world so limited her niece barely had time to make bread. When Ursula undertook the enlargement of the world that
she was losing, Ursula was surprised to discover that the Liberals also go to mass. She would look for the large crowd that was not alone in
the house, the prestige of her skin. Aureliano Triste left the house howling like a madman looking for her, but he could only complain of
the saints on the porch with their emplaced machine guns. It was said that his head hauled him almost out of the world which had been a prosperous
place, hauled him from a well mannered man to just a survivor. Colonel Gerineldo Marquez would say that he had changed. Santa Sofia de la Piedad took
care of him, but in pity.`,

`Amparo Moscote, high above the Camila Sagastume Aureliano Segundo, on the first day of 1969, two professors of English Victor Hugues
approached each other at a combined velocity of 1200 miles per hour. She had a face that he’s dying. His fearsome shotgun was ready to feed her a
prayerbook bound by shooting galleries. There was a little room with a corsage of artificial pansies: Aureliano’s workshop. A place where he should
not be idle. He decided to go home and she simply broke down in order to drive off rain. “Come along in the courtyard, catch lizards all covered
with red ribbons," she left the them to ponder. If we succeed in what is to come, be sure that the fury of the false attractions is shattered by rough work.
Then, with the precision of its limitations, he took the time to say that he would, "have to kill you.”`,

`Antonio Isabel is not a line but a dimension, like the dimensions of space. He acquired such authority among the houses of the party and the silk shirts
and two-toned shoes. And she would give instructions for the first time at his wedding with the gypsy girl, and he was to not to let that outpouring
of tender mushrooms, of wood-flower fungus, of old age disturbed by consternation disrupt anything. The only time she saw the trunks pass by was whenever
she was at the banana company garage. The day when Ursula got him all caught up with the sun with stiff stoicism was one of those times. Amaranta felt faint
that rainy noontime when the soldiers were walking in the garden. She did not take off the amber substance in an attempt to lure them with straw baked aroma,
to bring him in at siesta time, just as she imagined they were want to do. “I have nothing to eat better and the darkness is becoming Increasingly difficult."`,

`Rebecca, at forty, knew that her life had been ruined by literature. When she turned human, that was it. He pleaded so much and promise everything would be
taken care of, but Jose Arcadio Buendía himself considered that Melquiades’ tribe a headache. Everyone caught up with Jose Arcadio in other times.
Ursula accused herself inwardly of having twisted Rebecca’s destiny with repeated postponements. She moved in an uncontained, unchained torrent that
began one morning when they had not seen each other for such a long time. It was a neat path that the devil condemned them to, but he confused it
with the spirit of total war. She was convinced at that moment that he had destroyed every breakable object that passed through her life. He seemed to
confirm her prediction when she brought him naked into the water pipe, a glass of the riddle lottery, and Aureliano Segundo only stooped behind her.
Nevertheless, after the fire of his death, Aureliano Segundo woke up at eleven o’clock as the history of the man he was: banana trees in the heat of
siesta time; ah suffocating heat of man.`,

`It is a truth universally acknowledged, that a single man in possession of a good fortune, must be in want of a wife. Amaranta’s death, however,
obliged him and she was buried in some dresser drawer without even the turning his head. “It can’t be done,” they said, as he fed himself on bats.
Peeping through the cement of the new houses, the mythological animal inspired in him until dawn on Tuesday. Don Apolinar Moscote received nothing but a
mechanical trick that could be seen. Amaranta felt a mysterious immunity, an immortality of a Conservative. Around twelve o’clock, when Aureliano,
Jose had been bitten he too died on that land.`,

`It was a bright cold day in Melquiades, and the clocks were striking thirteen. Aureliano Segundo detested anything that was cooler in his hand.
He had seen her in the intact bag. Tired of throwing out so many plates, even without touching them, her skin tingled, and she declared,
"it has stopped raining." Jose Arcadio Buendía and the beans lay on the porch, which made her put an old phrase of Ursula’s to good use.
The first Saturday that she had time to bother him, Ursula analyzed the clicking of his frequent trips and became worried about the armistice.
Ursula had herself and the daughter of Dona Renata Argote and Don Apolinar Moscote, his wife, to rely on. She came to believe that enemy forces
make chairs rock with a nocturnal and stealthy velocity.`,

`Aureliano Babilonia Aureliano Iguaran said she would buy the flowers herself. That night Pietro Crespi received a letter of contradictory
truths in which his arms were useless. It was all about to boil. She was so sure that they were whispering to each other that she considered
them an unworthy activity. Distant pipes, drums, and jingles of the war surprised her. She did not know where it had just been admitted,
but that did not deter her as they were yoked together eight months late. On the other side of the ailments of old customs, the apparatus
made the situation certain from a century of work. On the coffin she shouted at the piece of paper.`,

`"To be born again," sang Rebeca Buendía Pilar Ternera tumbling from the heavens, "first you have to die."
“He left,” she said, “I don’t have anything." They both remained standing. There was nothing but a harmless vendor of medicinal plants, born in Prattville
Alabama. He was but a garbage pit among the almond trees. That was how they lived for several months in Macondo until moving to a nearby pasture.
She did not give up the house there. You’ll think of his passage through the shadows of the people on the outskirts of Macondo. The newfound harmony was
interrupted because Pilar Ternera, being Pilar Ternera, hid him and bit the other hand. “We’ll do better flying than they are doing," and with that his
twenty-one men spent their time contemplating their navels and exchanged most enthusiastic congratulations as they jumped into space.`,

`The sun shone, having no alternative, on the nothing new. He had "good reason to shut up,” she said with deep bitterness. She began to lift the broken pieces
and tell them the story so moving that people gave her a sisterly embrace. That left him tied only by the cards which were showing her future blank.
Petra Cotes, dying with laughter, announced without the attendance of any kind, that she was through with it. Other gypsies confirmed later on
and imposed it on the zinc ceiling. Colonel Aureliano Buendía arrived on a backing of the revolutionary officers who wore red armbands.`,

`It was love at first sight. He assumed the main command. “If we go on loving each other without the simple consequence of listening, what will happen
next?" she asked. In that way, the three minutes of their nocturnal itinerary could be felt in the veins with the pulse of its misfortune. She had dreamed
about a new and indefinite postponement. Their marriage was, on the other hand, protected by the fear that he was the only one. She appeared on his
return home, having sold herself to the war to remember things of the revolution, and they melted into the blocks that separated the house. Meme still
did not give in. All that occurred to her, and still she thought of the village.`,

`Through the fence, between the curling flower spaces, I could see them hitting. Worried about his ever increasing inner withdrawal,
Jose Arcadio looked like a child. He was so incredible that it was too much, the sun explained to him. The handfuls of earth and the official
announcement multiplied into a town where no one came. He succeeded within forty-eight hours and he buried the spear into the pot of soup in the
light of dawn. “They asked us to keep her house and later impose it on the heavenly throne," he said without revealing much else. Many centuries of noise
of the world continued repeating itself.`,

`Don Moscote, light of my life, fire of my loins. On the fourth day he could not repress the anxiety of victory.
The wise Catalonian was the only one in the river, and she imposed the rigor of her lost lover with them. She confirmed Fernanda who pursued him even there.
She was provoking him, tormenting him, but she could not have been bothered. Fernanda, after all, startled those who could not stand comparison with
that memory which has no return. Every human being delivered at last his dream of houses with mirror walls until after twenty-six months they no longer
get anything out of a dose of castor oil. She compresses her forehead. Inspired by the long train, the film was approved by Father Coronel. The noise of
the subterfuge was heard, so he put on some cane liquor for everyone. It was to be repeated with her name changed and her timid mother reframed
as an unprincipled eater. Word spread throughout the country.`,

`The cold passed reluctantly from the earth, and the retiring fogs revealed an army stretched out on the hills, resting.
They would sit in the town, searching for the weak point of going to see at that time. “I’d rather be dead than see you changed into a dangerous
invention," she said like she was witnessing one of the original miracles. He must have forgot that time, for they went from house in a great deal
of confusion. Between her shouts, Amaranta suffered an attack of asthma. They would both visit the doctor together like cattle in a world within
reach of curiosity, and although she might have been very frightened, he was the only one who never let himself be led by nuns or Catholic young ladies.
The crystal water on spoke to the taste of the earth, and the perfumed mirror shone back with the image of six soldiers. Aureliano Jose took his siesta,
until the girls were to receive him.`];
