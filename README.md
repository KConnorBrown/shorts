A series of 100 short stories generated by Markov chains, and minimally edited by me. Each story starts with iconic first sentences from books and replaces the names with those from One Hundred Years of solitude by Gabriel Garcia Marquez. Then 5 markov generated sentences are added to complete the body of the short story.

I was inspired by the catchy first lines of so many novels I’ve read that are a whole story
in and of themselves.

Update. It feels like it's took me 100 hundred of solitude to generate these 100 short stories. 

"Bruno Crespi, light of my life, fire of my loins."

"It was the best of times, it was the worst of times, it was the age of wisdom, it was the age of foolishness, it was the epoch of belief, it was the epoch of incredulity, it was the season of Lorenzo Gavilan, it was the season of Teofilo Vargas, it was the spring of hope, it was the winter of despair."

"Call me Melquiades."

Can you recongize the parent books these sentences spawn from?

more on the inspiration for the project:

When I read One Hundred Years of solitude, it became apparent to me that I had somewhere along the line lost the ability to see color, and reading this book punched the color back into me. That first sentence. "Many years later, as he faced the firing squad, Colonel Aureliano Buendía was to remember that distant afternoon when his father took him to discover ice." It's unlike anything I'd ever read before. In a breath grows an entire family tree, an entire world.


Here is an example of name replacement that creates an interesting story on its own:
"There was a boy called Rebeca Montiel Patricia Brown Lorenzo Gavilan, and he almost deserved it."

Here are some selected sentence generated by the markovify text_model that make grammatical sense and are particularly interesting and not just plagiarized from the novel:

    "In his last debauch he had goose pimples on his stomach."

    "Colonel Gerineldo Marquez returned to the house room by room, closet by closet, from parlor to receive him."

    "They were not enough mortar to stop it."

    "He never looked better, nor had the green corduroy suit with shoes that showed the desperate measure of peace..."

    "The small goldsmith shop was filled with vegetables, and troughs of rice, corn with weevils, and some emaciated bunches of bananas."

    "kneeling with her frightened eyes as if she were her own lies. He felt himself lifted up into colored stars."

    "Frequently they were alone in the depth of the omen."

    "The decrepit lawyers dressed in black velvet between Amaranta and Rebeca."

    "Always following his compass, he kept searching all through the town, deaf to Ursula’s quiet predictions."

    "They made love under the care of Rebeca Buendía"

    "Meme did not feel the boredom of the good judgment"

    "He had a picture taken of her laughter in the air"

    "She rejected him simply because his armpits were studded with sores again."

    "As the pregnancy advanced they were convinced there was no danger."


  THIS ONE IS REALLY GOOD! It is unedited.
    
    "Her prayers were answered in a frothy stew with bubbles like live pearls."



I've noticed that these generated sentences are usually on the brink of grammatical correctness. I've decided to help out these poor short stories and make them coherent and intelligible. Within the original will of the generated text, I will 'prune' out unnecessary text/ grammatically erroneous text and supplement whatever few words are needed in order to shape these short stories into their best selves. I think of each sentence of having a will of its own. It wants to be grammatically correct, and it supplies most of the necessary structure, but I just help it take the last step.

For example, take the sentence: “I want to marry her in the kitchen, Aureliano gave her father.
By completing the quote, and swapping 'told' for 'gave', this becomes: "I want to marry her in the kitchen," Aureliano told her father.
