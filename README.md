assignment two: short stories

Start with iconic first sentences from books and replace the names with those from one hundred Years of solitude. Craft a short story from there.
At the end, rewrite the first sentence to match the story.

inspired by the catchy first lines of so many novels I’ve read that are a whole story
in and of themselves; inspired by Hemingway’s baby shoes short story; inspired by a
fiction prompt my friend mentioned at Tealuxe the other day

Update. It feels like it's took me 100 hundred of solitude to generate these 100 short stories.

arrange the 100 short stories in a large poster format in the formation of a tree with the ghost of Jose Arcardio Buendia tied to the tree

I go through and replace the proper nouns of the sentences with names from the name list of 100 years of solitude; I tried to keep
pronouns consistent with the pronouns from the book, but there is no nltk feature that identifys masculine/feminine/neutral pronouns so I rolled with it as is. Sometimes it's nonsensible, Sometimes delightful:

"Bruno Crespi, light of my life, fire of my loins."

"It was the best of times, it was the worst of times, it was the age of wisdom, it was the age of foolishness, it was the epoch of belief, it was the epoch of incredulity, it was the season of Lorenzo Gavilan, it was the season of Teofilo Vargas, it was the spring of hope, it was the winter of despair."

"Call me Melquiades."

Can you recongize the parent books these sentences spawn from?

more on the inspiration for the project:

When I read One Hundred Years of solitude, it became apparent to me that I had somewhere along the line lost the ability to see color, and reading this book punched the color back into me.

That first sentence.

"Many years later, as he faced the firing squad, Colonel Aureliano Buendía was to remember that distant afternoon when his father took him to discover ice."

That first sentence was something unlike anything I'd ever read before. In a breath, an entire family tree, an entire world.
