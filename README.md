inspired by the catchy first lines of so many novels I’ve read that are a whole story
in and of themselves; inspired by Hemingway’s baby shoes short story; inspired by a
fiction prompt my friend mentioned at Tealuxe the other day

It feels like it took me 100 hundred of solitude to generate these 100 short stories

arrange the 100 short stories in a large poster format in the formation of a tree with the ghost of Jose Arcardio Buendia tied to the tree

scratch the archetypes idea in favor of a 100 years of solitude inspired collection of 100 short stories

I go through and replace the proper nouns of the sentences with names from the name list of 100 years of solitude; I tried to keep
pronouns consistent with the pronouns from the book, but there is no nltk feature that identifys masculine/feminine/neutral pronouns so
I roled with it as is
